# 05-calender-app
In this assignment I was given instruction to build a single day calender app in which when the page was loaded it would display the current date at the top of the page. The time blocks are seperated by the work hours of the day.(9am-5pm) Also the text areas are color coded based on the current hour of the day to show whether each time block is past, present, or in the future in accordance to the current time in the day. Finally when a user types text in the text area and hits the save button, their text is saved into the local storage and remains on the screen when reloaded.
